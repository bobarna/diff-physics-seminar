# Seminar Write-up on Differentiable Physics

Project work for the [*Master-Seminar - Deep Learning in Physics (IN2107,
IN0014)*](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/cg/teaching/summer-term-22/deep-learning-in-physics/)
course at TUM in the 2022 Summer semester.

The seminar paper gives an overview of [*Learning to Control PDEs with Differentiable
Physics*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07457.pdf).

## Presentation
The slides of the corresponding *(originally 25 minutes)* presentation  gives
a broader overview of the topic:
- Differentiable Physics
    - Motivation
    - Forward Physics
    - Differentiable *("backwards")* Physics
    - Examples
- Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
- Method and Results of the Paper
- Other Examples and Outlook
    - Enhancing Simulations with Neural Networks (NNs)
    - Inductive Physical Bias

As the presentation contains videos, it is also available as an online
PowerPoint.
